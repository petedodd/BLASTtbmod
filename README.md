# BLASTtbmod

This is an R package for use in BLAST modelling work.

## Installation

The following odin-related packages must be installed (probably) from [GitHub](https://github.com/): `dust`, `mcstate`, `odin.dust`.
The packages `cpp11`, `sata.table`, and `ggplot2` are also required.

While this is a private repo, the easiest way to install is to clone this repo and then install using `devtools`

``` r
devtools::install("my.local.path.to/BLASTtbmod")
```

where `my.local.path.to` needs editing for your filesystem
